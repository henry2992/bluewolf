## Getting Started

You will require ruby and bundler to be installed to run through this exercise. Once installed, ensure the dependencies are installed by running `bundle`.

Once installed, you should be able to run the following commands:

- `bundle exec rake`  : Runs the application and prints the output to the terminal;
- `bundle exec rspec` : Runs the test suite;
